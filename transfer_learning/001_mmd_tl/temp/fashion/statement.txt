the experiments carried out here compare the performance of 
1. mnist + usps as training set, usps as test set.

the poisoning is carried out in setting 1 with poisoning rate 1.0, and the method is LABEL FLIPPING.

STATEMENT:
1. label flipping wont affect the MMD, so the drop of performance should be out of the influence in
   soft loss, means the dataset's being affected likewise in usual deep learning
