the experiments carried out here compare the performance of 
1. usps dataset only
2. mnist dataset only
3. mnist + usps as training set, usps as test set.

the poisoning is carried out in setting 3, and the method is LABEL FLIPPING.

STATEMENT:
1. label flipping wont affect the MMD, so the drop of performance should be out of the influence in
   soft loss, means the dataset's being affected likewise in usual deep learning
